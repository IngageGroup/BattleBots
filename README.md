# BattleBots
Simple, wifi controlled robots for demonstrating Arduino development and because robots!

# Slides
[Slideshow from Dev Days](http://slides.com/andrewcanterbury/battlebots)
Also available in the Slides folder in this repo

## Code Folder
This folder contains the Arduino Code for the robot and the html/js/css for the control page.

## PCB
This contains the Fritzing files used in the design of the custom PCB we are using, as well as the gerber files needed to make the board or have it produced. 

## Tools Used 
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Used for writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino compatible boards.

[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org) - Used to design custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board) to make it easier to hook everything up.

##### Ways to expand your robot
- [ ] Host html/js/css from the robot so you can drive from a phone/tablet
- [ ] Add additional motors for more control or weapons!
- [ ] Control your bot with arrow keys or a game controller
