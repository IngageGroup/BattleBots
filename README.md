# BattleBots
Simple, wifi controlled robots for demonstrating Arduino development and because robots!

## Code Folder
This folder contains the Arduino Code for the robot and the html/js/css for the control page.

## PCB
This contains the Fritzing files used in the design of the custom PCB we are using, as well as the gerber files needed to make the board or have it produced. 

## Tools Used 
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Used for writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino compatible boards.

[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org) - Used to design custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board) to make it easier to hook everything up.

##### TODO
- [ ] Finish Fritzing breadboard and Schematic views
- [ ] Remove OTA code from arduino file
- [ ] Add server and inline interface code to arduino file
- [ ] Create slideshow for talk and add to repo. (using reveal.js)
- [ ] Create wiki with instructions and troubleshooting
